# FinFun
FinFun is a fun and interactive app to teach users basic personal finance methods in a gamified manner. It is my Swift Student Challenge submission to Apple for WWDC2023.

The game is targeted towards young adults who may now be taking on more responsibility when it comes to their financials. 
The world of finance can be difficult to understand sometimes and my app aims to help you understand all the things you can do in a fun and engaging manner.

The game is divided into two sections: **Learn** and **Play**.

## Learn

In the Learn section, users can learn about various personal finance options to grow their money, such as investment in stocks or fixed deposits.

Each lesson has been beautifully crafted to meaningfully convey the purpose of each personal finance method. The content has been summarised to ensure that the user is not overloaded with information.

## Play

Before starting the game, users get the ability to customise their game experience by creating a game profile.
Preferences in this game profile are saved and applied during the game and can vastly alter the course of how a game proceeds.

In the actual game, players can see transactions that are applied to their account as time goes on. There's a default time limit of 50 years and an initial deposit of $10000.

The game also simulates "Life Events" such as medical emergencies or accidents and charges you accordingly.

In addition to the above, the player can invest via multiple options to grow their money, adding a twist into the works and making the game more fun!
